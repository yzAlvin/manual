# Pitfalls

## Impostor Syndrome

pretty normal, expect everyone to experience  unless have ego size of moon

from grugbrain:

> "is maybe nature of programming for most grug to feel impostor and be ok with is best: nobody imposter if everybody imposter"

## Paralysis by Analysis

seems very common

recommend to just start, there is no 'perfect' beginner language, most likely/most definitely will need to learn more than a single language anyway. 

start with one and stick with it. recommend javascript because everyone has web browser or python because very easy syntax

## Fear of Looking Dumb

nothing to fear, what is the worst that can happen? if others think you are dumb then it's toxic work culture and probably dont want to work there anyway, or it means can make your money without high expectations!

alternatively its an opportunity to learn something new, or an opportunity to simplify something that was unnecessarily complex!

## Little or No Experience

everybody start somewhere.

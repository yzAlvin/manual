# javascript

need a javascript runtime environment to execute JavaScript code outside a web browser

## web browser

most (all?) web browsers have dev tools which you can reach with `F12` or right click -> inspect

there will be a `console` tab where you can type and run code

you could write your code in vscode, and then copy + paste it to the console window to run it

## node

[node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

with a `.js` file, run command `node path/to/.js file` in terminal

### example

create a file `example.js` with the content

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

run `node example.js` in a terminal to run the code in the file.

# editor

you could use any text editor like notepad

problem is there are better tools that can help you write code

examples are notepad++, sublime text, visual code they offer syntax highlighting and with language server protocol can have code suggestions

i recommend [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for beginner

## other

can also use an integrated development environment (IDE), that is specific for the language you write

* Java - IntelliJ
* Python Pycharm
* C# - Visual Studio (not the same as visual studio code)

often has more powerful features but more specific to a language

can also use less GUI and more keyboard focused editors like vim, emacs, don't recommend for beginners, but definitely worth learning if interested

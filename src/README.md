# Smooth Brain Writeup

![smooth brain](smooth_brain.png)

this is simple book/guide/tutorial/advice on things i think you should know as a (aspiring?) software developer/engineer (i use it interchangeably bcos i dont know the difference)

dont have any cool credentials but have mentored few people in software development industry; many friends want career change but dont know where to start, maybe this ok starting point. just want to help anybody succeed in this rewarding career

heavily influence by [grugbrain dev](https://grugbrain.dev/)

## Brain Dump

software landscape constantly evolving so need to constantly grow knowledge and adapt

everyday will learn something new (not hyperbole)

important not to get caught up trying to be a 'master' of something, if you can understand the basics or an intermediate level that is quite often good enough, there is diminishing returns as you learn more

in my opinion the most successful software devs take initiative to learn (dont have to do extra coding outside of work if you dont want to but it doesnt hurt)

## How to Use This Book

rather than learning by strictly following tutorials with rigid rules, this book aim to teach by **doing** small projects

no real structure, can go through linearly or pick out things interesting

if absolutely no clue, this my suggestion:

* Basic HTML
* Basic CSS
* Basic JavaScript
* Basic terminal commands
* Basic Git

(methinks it is absolutely possible to get a job knowing just these things)

# Smooth Brain Software Writeup

this is a simple book/guide/tutorial/advice on things i think you should know as a (aspiring?) software developer/engineer (i use it interchangeably bcos i dont know the difference)

dont have any cool credentials but have mentored few people in software development industry; many friends want career change but dont know where to start, maybe this ok starting point
